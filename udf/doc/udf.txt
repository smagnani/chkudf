UDF Filesystem version 0.7	(Experimental isn't kidding!)

If you encounter problems with reading UDF discs using this driver,
please report them to linux_udf@hootie.lvld.hp.com, which is the
developer's list.

The driver is known to work 'ok' for discs written with Adaptec's
DirectCD 2.5, although there's a problem with mis-reported file
sizes, effecting 'du' and 'ls -ls'.

The 'find' command doesn't like some directories. 

The 'diff' command works ok on individual files, but complains
about file errors when run recursively. 


 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 *      unhide		Show otherwise hidden files.

 *	debug=		Set the debugging level for _all_ UDF filesystems.
 *      novrs           Skip volume sequence recognition 
 *		(my RW cd recorded by ADAPTEC DirectCD 2.5 has no such 
 *		 sequence but otherwise is fine)
 *
 *	The following expect a parameter given in 'sectors':
 *
 *	session=	Set the CDROM session (default= last session)
 *	anchor=		Override standard anchor location. (default= 256)
 *	volume=		Override the VolumeDesc location.
 *	partition=	Override the PartitionDesc location.
 *	partroot=	Override the partitionStartingLocation.

 *	The following expect a parameter given in 'blocks', 
 *	(which are then added to the partition root to get a 'sector'):
 *
 *	fileset=	Override the fileset block location.
 *	rootdir=	Override the root directory location.
 *		WARNING: overriding the rootdir to a non-directory may
 *			 yield highly unpredictable results.
