/* ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Linux(r) UDF Filesystem Driver
 * Version: 0.7
 *
 * This is Andrew's second "patch" vs kernel 2.1.62, 
 * converted to a standalone package. Then many changes made. :-)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------- */

REQUIRED:
	Linux version 2.1.56 or higher
	
COMPILING:
	type: "make"

TESTING:
	type "insmod module/udf.o", 
	then "mount -t udf /dev/scd0 /mnt"
		(assuming /dev/scd0 is your scsi cdrom)
		(Substitute "scd0" and "/mnt" as appropriate for your system)

I've tested this on my system with kernel 2.1.125, a Ricoh MP-6200S,
a UDF 1.5 disc created by Adaptec DirectCD, and the cheap-o
SCSI card (aha152x compatible) that came with the Ricoh.

I can mount/umount a udf filesystem without crashing my system.
I can view the directory structure of the file system, including file
dates and sizes. However, directories are limited in size, to maybe
30-40 entries, depending on name lengths (1 2k block.)

Files can be read and used! (As of version 0.5). However, files are limited
to DVD compatible use, that is, only one 'extent' per file. That means
the file space must be contiguous on the disc.


That's pretty much all that's currently implemented. If you want
