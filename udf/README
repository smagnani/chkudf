/* ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Linux(r) UDF Filesystem Driver
 * Version: 0.8
 *
 * This is Andrew's second "patch" vs kernel 2.1.62, 
 * converted to a standalone package. Then many changes made. :-)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------- */

REQUIRED:
	Linux version 2.1.70 or higher
	
COMPILING:
	type: "make"

INSTALLING:
	edit Make.conf to fix directories for modules & tools.
	type: "make install"

TESTING:
	type "modprobe udf", 
	then "mount -t udf /dev/scd0 /mnt"
		(assuming /dev/scd0 is your scsi cdrom)
		(Substitute "scd0" and "/mnt" as appropriate for your system)

I've tested this on my system with kernel 2.2.1, a Ricoh MP-6200S,
a UDF 1.5 disc created by Adaptec DirectCD, and the cheap-o
SCSI card (aha152x compatible) that came with the Ricoh.

I can mount/umount a udf filesystem without crashing my system.
I can view the directory structure of the file system, including file
dates and sizes. 

Files can be read and used! (As of version 0.5). 
A writable filesystem is planned, but no work has been done. Sorry.

That's pretty much all that's currently implemented. If you want
to help out, subscribe to the linux_udf mailing list below.
