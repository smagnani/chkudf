udf 1.02:

chk img descr
	-> Reinoud: what do you mean by this? -- REW


  permissions ok?
    -- OK! Thomas wrote "all ones", the DVD Demystified disk shows
           the "expected" values. 

  wrong link cnt
    -- Only in Root dir. Probably root-dir-entries incorrectly inherit
       the link count from the actual root directory. 

  extended attr.
	-> Reinoud: what do you mean by this? -- REW

  files in "folder 1" wrong contents
    -- Fixed. (Name comparisons were done erroneously)

kmsg, busy inodes
  -- Fixed? (Bens work?)

gcc warns  (will fix these on tuesday (dec 15 1998). -- REW)
  -- integer constant out of range: Has to do with "long long" type. 
	Something is wrong. I don't expect mkudf to work in this state.... 
  -- Wrong arguments to a callback function. (or something like that)
	-> Fix declarations.
  -- chkudf is compiled with -ggdb which implies -lg which doesn't
	work on my system.
  -- Some "unused variables". 

- Reduce debugging output a bit.... Hmm. Ok Seems it is not on by default.
  -> Ask reinoud how he turns on debugging. :-)



Check if other images work.

- Sequential.img:

	- File contents in most files are not correct.
	- "2 identical files in here" -> Not identical, references past 
		end-of-disk.

- SparedBlks.img: 
	- Seems OK.

- Strategy4096:
	- "Wrong instance of "File 1". resp 2.
	- I guess our implementation falls for the pitfall.
