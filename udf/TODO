udf 1.02:

wrong link cnt
  -- Only in Root dir. Probably root-dir-entries incorrectly inherit
     the link count from the actual root directory. 
      -- Seems to be a bug in the image -- BLF (Sequential.img has correct link counts)

gcc warns  (will fix these on tuesday (dec 15 1998). -- REW)
  -- chkudf is compiled with -ggdb which implies -lg which doesn't
	work on my system.
  -- Some "unused variables". 

mount ro -> -w- perms?
  -- umask implemented -- DGB

remount support
  -- some things function, needs more work -- DGB

Check if other images work:

- Sequential.img:

	- File contents in most files are not correct.
            -- fixed! -- BLF
	- "2 identical files in here" -> Not identical, references past 
		end-of-disk.
            -- also fixed :) -- BLF

- SparedBlks.img: 
	- Seems OK.

- Strategy4096:
	- "Wrong instance of "File 1". resp 2.
	- I guess our implementation falls for the pitfall.

----

link count:
    \_silly*Name?.#0DCE/.#25E9 has link count 4, must be 2
    . doesn't reflect no. of subdirs

    Sequential.img seems OK!

'df' errors:
    [UDF1.02.img]
    <7>udf: ident mismatch block 292, ident 8 != 256
    <3>udf: udf_count_free failed
	-- Fixed, possibly. Should read SpaceBitmap not FileSet -- DGB

    [SparedBlks.img]
    <7>udf: ident mismatch block 2497, ident 0 != 256
    <3>udf: udf_count_free failed

Strategy4096 aint no good.  It picks te first entry, should be the last.

mkudf:
	We should start working on making 'mkudf' a working utility.
