10/02/98 dgb    Implemented some changes suggested by HJA Sandkuyl.
                Moved files around to support user-land access to 
                filesystem via library
10/04/98        Implemented table-based lookup for timestamp conversions
                Fixed unicode convertions, added volident field to superblock
10/06/98        Implemented directory operations, most of which work!

10/07/98 dgb    Milestone reached. Rudimentary directory and file reading.
                Limited in number of directory entries, though, about 30-40.

10/16/98        Attempting some multi-session support.

10/18/98        Fixed some directory problems; still limited but
                doesn't seem to crash or oops now.
                Enhanced "df" output a little.  Generally much more stable.

11/29/98        Added better support for 'extents', long directories are ok now.
                Incorporated some changes from Ben Fennema, including mkudf.
                Still can't handle the "Sequential.img" test case from Adaptec.
                Improved taglist and added a new dumpfe tool.

12/6/98         Good results with Thomas Tempelmann's UDF1.02.img, although
                still needs some 'short_ad' updates, and filename translation.
                Superficial support for virtual & sparable partitions.

12/8/98 blf     Partition support for Spared Blocks and Virtual Partitions.
                Definite bugs in Virtual Partitions (lastblock only set correctly
                on files).

12/10/98 rl     Changed "." and ".." file name translation into human
                readable form.

12/11/98 rl/rew Fixed incorrect name compare (udf_lookup).

12/13/98 rew    Cleanup of CHANGES/TODO

12/14/98 blf    Full partition support. Code cleanups. No warnings! :)
                UDF1.02.img, SparedBlks.img, and Sequential.img all work.
