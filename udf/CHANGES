10/02/98 dgb    Implemented some changes suggested by HJA Sandkuyl.
                Moved files around to support user-land access to 
                filesystem via library
10/04/98        Implemented table-based lookup for timestamp conversions
                Fixed unicode convertions, added volident field to superblock
10/06/98        Implemented directory operations, most of which work!

10/07/98 dgb    Milestone reached. Rudimentary directory and file reading.
                Limited in number of directory entries, though, about 30-40.

10/16/98        Attempting some multi-session support.

10/18/98        Fixed some directory problems; still limited but
                doesn't seem to crash or oops now.
                Enhanced "df" output a little.  Generally much more stable.

11/29/98        Added better support for 'extents', long directories are ok now.
                Incorporated some changes from Ben Fennema, including mkudf.
                Still can't handle the "Sequential.img" test case from Adaptec.
                Improved taglist and added a new dumpfe tool.

12/6/98         Good results with Thomas Tempelmann's UDF1.02.img, although
                still needs some 'short_ad' updates, and filename translation.
                Superficial support for virtual & sparable partitions.

12/8/98 blf     Partition support for Spared Blocks and Virtual Partitions.
                Definite bugs in Virtual Partitions (lastblock only set correctly
                on files).

12/10/98 rl     Changed "." and ".." file name translation into human
                readable form.

12/11/98 rl/rew Fixed incorrect name compare (udf_lookup).

12/13/98 rew    Cleanup of CHANGES/TODO

12/14/98 blf    Full partition support. Code cleanups. No warnings! :)
                UDF1.02.img, SparedBlks.img, and Sequential.img all work.

12/15/98 rl     Fixed udf/tools gcc warnings (except, on purpose, the mkudf
                write_fileentry4 and dumpfe partstart ones).  Updated TODO.

12/19/98 dgb    Added semaphore and reorganized udf_iget. 
                Worked on byte order (incomplete). Implemented umask.
                Fixed block size reporting, and count_free error.

12/20/98 blf    Completed byte ordering (perhaps).
                Support for strategy 4096
                Really basic support for finding the unallocated space bitmap
                (we really need support for unallocated space tables +
                freed space tables/bitmaps...)

2/9/99 dgb		Tested with Kernel 2.2.1. 
				Added some ioctl's for extended attributes and volume ident.
				Added UDF_COMPILING define to udf_fs_i.h to allow kernel to
				compile without gagging on lb_addr.
				Minor change to mkudf so it gives help w/'mkudf' and nothing
				else. Changed 'dump' to 'dumpsect' to avoid conflict.

03/07/99 blf	Beginnings of write support.. chmod + rm of files.
				New implementation of udf_bmap			
				Updates to mkudf

03/12/99 blf	Bug fixes. Support for reading length on MMC-3 drives.

03/30/99 blf	Continuation of write support. creation of files. (minus the
				case where a new block needs to be allocated to fit the FID
				in the block)
				Moved all the code that bangs on the CDROM to lowlevel.c
				Added code to do variable -> fixed block translation for
				reading CDRW's on drives that only support variable packet
				reading.
				Futzed with the debugging code a bunch. Added udf_debug and
				udf_info.

04/09/99 blf	Added Configure script

04/19/99 blf	Support for link, symlink, and mknod

05/12/99 blf	Initial support for writing (no sparse files)

05/28/99 blf	Fixed various directory entry writing bugs. Added rename
				for files and directories. Add fsync support (untested)
				Handle VAT's that are in the ICB.

06/03/99 blf	Fixed writing for files > 1 block
				Started spliting out support for AD_IN_ICB files.

06/11/99 dgb	Added a UDF_RECOVERY compile option and update to ./src/namei.c
				that enables a ".B=xxx" filename syntax, useful for recovering 
				files from damaged discs.  Modified ./patch/Makefile to 
				assist in building kernel patches.

06/16/99 blf	(Hopefully) fixed rename for versions <= 2.2.5
				Fixed sparse files
				Fixed block allocation algorithm to function properly

07/15/99 blf	Fixed deletes (truncate problems)
				Fixed various write bugs
				Add block extension to truncate routine
				Recalculate crc on udf_insert_aext
				Changes to mkudf

08/19/99 blf	Ported to linux 2.3.7+
				Rewrote inode_getblk

09/02/99 blf	Fixed unicode and anchor location bugs

09/16/99 dgb	Fixed Configure to handle RedHat 6.0's kernel (which reports 
		"UTS_RELEASE 2.2.5-15".) Fixed Configure to make symlinks for 
		patch and src directories. Modified patch system to dynamically 
		create diff files, instead of using pre-build diffs, and to 
		better handle the apply/unapply. First draft of a FAQ.
		Modified "make lib" to make both static and shared libraries.

09/18/99 dgb	Updated patch system to properly apply/unapply from kernel 2.2,
		And updated patch-2.3 to only do updates, since the driver
		is now in the kernel (2.3.17+).
