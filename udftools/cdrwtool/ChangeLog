	* Split the commands from the main program
	* Merged with new mkudffs code

Ver 0.1		27/10/00
	- Fix wrong warning when using IMMED bit for format/blank
	  when command completes
	- Default to setting mode2-form1 write type
	- Print sense on failed command

Ver 0.02 Alpha	00/02/02
	- addded reserve track option
	- progress indicator for format / blank (only when the device
	  "disconnects" through the IMMED bit -- see BLOCKING_CMD, and
	  if the drive supports the progress through sense stuff). Beware
	  that it is pretty crappy...
	- print OPC info in print_disc_track_info
	- do manual locking/unlocking to prevent lock door errors while
	  doing a format/blank with IMMED set.
	- added the -q quick setup option.

Ver 0.01 Alpha	99/11/09
	- Mostly untested ;)

Todo:
	- Set sensible write speed, don't default to DEFAULT_SPEED.

Drives tested and known to work:
	- HP 8210i, 9xxx (progress indicator works)
	- Sony CRX100E (without progress indicator)
	- Yamaha CRW6416SX (SCSI, no progress indicator)
	- Yamaha CRW8424SX (SCSI, no progress indicator)
	- Plextor PlexWriter 12/4/32
